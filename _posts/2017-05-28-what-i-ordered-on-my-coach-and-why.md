I have a 2017 Ventana 3412.

- Residential frig with 6 batteries. More than enough juice to go a few days. Only takes a couple of hours to charge up on the generator when they do run low which is less noisy than many portable generators. Get a Gen-Turi if you like and it will be a bit quieter still. The larger frig really reduces the number of trips to the store for cold stuff. The ice maker is awesome (margarita ville :smile:)

- With the slides in, its narrow. Not a big deal IMO. Wider would be nice but hardly a deal breaker in my book.

- Mechanical slide locks are expensive and a must. Just do it. They take most of the hassle out of slides (still have to deal with those darn floor protectors).

- Unless you take two hour showers skip the oasis/aquahot. It's pricey, requires annual maintenance and steals storage space from below. On larger units this might not be an issue but on the 3436/3412 storage is minimal. I've yet to exceed the water heater's capacity to keep up.

- People make way to much of a fuss about propane and DEF IMHO. Both are easy to get and deal with. I've spent about 3 weeks in mine and still have 3/4 of a tank of propane. Assuming you have the residential frig, you only use it for heating water and cooking and if you are plugged in then only cooking (use the electric for heating water).

- Get the MECHANICAL SLIDE LOCKS. They can't be retrofitted.

- Get the keyless door locks. Here's a tip, Opt for the painted latches instead of chrome. They blend in better, don't rust or pit like chrome and you'll save ~$800. I thought the keyless feature was frivalous but figured since I could not retrofit it later I better get it. I'm surprised how much I use and like it. Totally worth it.

- Get the painted side mirrors instead of chrome. Less likely to pit or rust and they're about ~$1000 less if memory serves.

-  I would not get the Nav system. The portable ones are as good or better and can be easily replaced as technology improves.

- Get the Hot water tap to front of the coach. Heck, it's only ~200.

- The Wineguard automatic antenna works great and I don't have to remember to put it up and down. Don't have satellite so I can't speak to it.

- Skip the oven and get the Microwave Convention oven. You'll get more cabinet space.

- Get the bigger heat pumps. You can never have enough AC

- Get the polar guard. You can never have enough insulation.

- Get the fiberglass roof. You can never..., Oh you know.

- One final thought. MECHANICAL SLIDE LOCKS! :cool:

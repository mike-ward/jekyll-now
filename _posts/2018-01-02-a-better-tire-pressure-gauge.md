title: "A Better Tire Pressure Gauge"  
...

Many RV websites recommend the Accutire Tire Pressure Gauge. I found it to be lacking. Cheap plastic, poor ergonomics, and odd-ball replacement batteries make this a poor choice for RV tires.

A much better one can be had for about the same price. It's made of metal, has great ergonomics, includes a light so you can find the tire valve when it's dark, and takes standard batteries. See my video for more details.

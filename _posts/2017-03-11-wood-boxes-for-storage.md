title: "Wood Boxes for Storage"  
...

I'm probably in the minority but I like boxes made from wood for
storage. The plastic ones are an efficient and cost-effective choice but
they lack substance. I prefer the old wood boxes used long ago for
bottled goods, etc. I pick them up at flea markets when I find them
(increasingly rare). When I can't find one to suit my needs, I make one.
Here's a video about making one such box. Yeah, I'm weird.

A very purple box.

title: "Tail Light for the Toad"  
...

We pull our toad (many RVers call towed vehicles "Toads") using a tow
dolly. The [tow
dolly](http://waywards.org/acme-tow-dolly-delivery-and-setup/) has
running and brake lights but they sit forward near the front wheels. At
night, it can be difficult to spot the rear of the toad because the tow
dolly running lights forward of the rear of the toad.

One solution is to simply turn on the toads parking lights, but this can
result in a dead battery if one is not careful. Another solution is to
attach a light to the rear of the toad.

There are after market magnetic lights that can attach to a car. Because
LED's draw less power it is practical to use battery powered lights.
This saves on having to wire into the toad's electrical harness.

I found one on eBay for $15.

Like many cars today, there's not much in way of flat surfaces. With all
the curves and plastic I could not find a satisfactory place attach the
light. The curved surfaces did not allow the magnets to get a good hold.

So I did a little online searching found one of these.

[Blank Trailer Metal Hitch Tube Cover Fits 2" Receivers (Square
Black)](http://a.co/hAkEA9N)

It fits into the trailer hitch receiver on our car. To make sure light
doesn't slide off the tube cover I put some super glue on the magnets
and permanently attached it to the plate. I can still access the battery
compartment to change them out.

So for about $30 I have a bright tail light without having to modify
the vehicle.

title:  "RVillage Rally One"  
...

The wife and I attended the inaugural RVillage Rally in Elkhart, Indiana
on March 17th to the 20th. This was our first rally.

Considering this was the organizers first rally, things went well for
the most part. The rally was well attended and the staff worked hard to
keep everything moving.

One of the perks of the rally was two passes to the [RV Hall of
Fame](http://www.rvmhhalloffame.org/). Talk about quirky contraptions!
There were some very *creative* campers. There were even campers for
Model T's!

We attended most of the seminars that were offered. Most speakers were
well organized and thoughtful in their presentations. The highlight for
me was attending Mike Sokol's, "Electric Shock" seminars. Mike is the
real deal. He's a Master Electrician, Electrical Engineer, Professor and
all around educator. He's also a bit of a, "Mad Scientist", which makes
is presentations particularly entertaining.

The vendor area was small but interesting. There was only one vendor
display that I would deem not relevant to RVing. [Fantasy RV
Tours](https://fantasyrvtours.com/) was of particular interest to us. We
attended 3 of their seminars. The caravan trips looked so amazing! After
many questions and lots of hand-wringing, we signed up for a 61 day trip
to Alaska. Yeah, we're pumped!

In the evening, there was a community area with two large, "Fire Bird
Sculptures", that burned piles of wood and created a welcoming community
space. On Saturday, there was a live band that was just a hoot.

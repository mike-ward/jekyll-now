title: "Windshield Wiper Standoffs"  
...

Leaves and other tree debris tend to collect on the windshield wipers
when they rest against the glass. This not only deteriorates the wiper
blades, but it also leaves a gooey mess on the windshield that has to be
cleaned off.

Pictured above is my solution. The spring clamps lift the wiper arm off
the glass allowing leaves and other debris to fall to the ground. If you
want to protect the wiper blades from UV deterioration, add some pipe
insulation over the wiper blades.

title: "The Shotgun Approach"  
...

OK, not really a shotgun but a shotgun shell bag. Tool belts are handy
for keeping tools at the ready when on a ladder or on the RV roof but
I've found them bigger and bulkier than I like. Plus they don't hold the
things like spray bottles and rags.

Instead, I use this old shotgun shell bag. It's smaller and easily holds
spray bottles, shock cords, spray paint cans, rags, bags of parts, etc.
It's smaller and less bulky than a tool belt which makes it nicer for
cleaning the outside and climbing the RV ladder.

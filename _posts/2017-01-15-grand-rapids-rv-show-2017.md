title: Grand Rapids RV Show 2017
...

We went to the Grand Rapids RV show in (surprise) Grand Rapids,
Michigan. Our goal was to see a Newmar Ventana 3412, similar to the one
we ordered. Back in November we looked at 5 or 6 different Newmar
coaches, but until today, we never actually saw the 3412 model.
Preferring not to wait some indeterminate time for one to appear at a
show or dealer lot, we went ahead and ordered one. It's not as risky as
it sounds given the number of images and video walk-throughs available.
Still, it was nice to finally sit in "our" coach. It was all we hoped it
would be.

Our family attended two seminars given by Cori and Greg Young of [The
Restless Youngs](http://therestlessyoungs.com). The Youngs have been
full-timing for about 3 years and shared a variety of tips on full-time
RV'ing, locating campgrounds, trip planning and "What to expect" when
you're on the road. Jean and I were pleasantly surprised at how much we
learned. Other than seeing our coach floor-model in person, it was the
highlight of the show. Definitely take the opportunity should you have
the chance to attend these seminars.

And in an amazing display of self-restraint, I managed not to buy any
gadgets for our once and future motorhome. I did see two gadgets (Jean's
term, not mine) worth mentioning.

And of course, no trip to Grand Rapids is complete without a visit to
[Founders Brewing Company](https://foundersbrewing.com/). Good eats,
great beer.

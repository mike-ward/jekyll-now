I found the easiest way to secure long hoses and heavy power cords is to
coil them and then tie them up with a used bicycle inner tube. I cut the
the portion with the value stem out.

I use bicycle inner tubes to tie-up and tie-down other things like grill
covers. They're free, they don't mar and they are robust.

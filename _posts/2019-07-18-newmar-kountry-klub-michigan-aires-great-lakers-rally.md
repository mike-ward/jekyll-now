Our first [Newmar Kountry Klub](https://newmarkountryklub.com) rally! What a hoot. We met at the Pine Ridge RV park located near [Frankenmuth, MI](https://www.frankenmuth.org). Not familiar with Frankenmuth? It's a tourist town with a Bavarian German theme.

We arrived Friday afternoon and the group met for dinner at Zhenders, a restaurant famous for its family-style, all you can eat, chicken dinners. There were maybe 20 of us in total. Good times, good beer, good food. How can you go wrong?

The rest of the weekend was campfires and potlucks. Lots of downtime for naps and sightseeing. It was also a Christmas in July theme. Many of the motorhomes displayed Christmas decorations. I wore a Santa cap and beard and got the appropriate glib responses. Yeah, I'm a big (Christmas?) ham!

Also, a shoutout to Debbie and Evan Hughes, Newmar's [Members at Large](https://newmarkountryklub.com/members-at-large/). Good people with a ton of knowledge about all things Newmar.

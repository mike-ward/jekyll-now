...

So my family is doing this crazy thing of buying a Class A motorhome. We
have never owned a motorhome before and so I thought I would document
some of our experiences. If anything, it should serve as a, "don't make
this mistake" guide. :smile:

Being tent campers for years this is quite a step up for us. To be
honest though we haven't tent camped for a few years because it's a bit
of hassle. What really drives the decision (for me) is that we just want
a better driving experience. Cars and even SUV's kind of suck for long
interstate drives. And then there's stopping for food and gas and not
being able to move around while in transit. I think it's kind of cool to
be able to pull over when you find a nice place and have your living
space just ready to go.

I'll talk more about our decision on a Class A motorhome in a future
post. Mostly, I just wanted to get this blog started during our
"learning" stage while stuff is fresh in our minds.

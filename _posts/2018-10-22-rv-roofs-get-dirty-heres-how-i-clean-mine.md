title: "RV roofs get dirty. Here's how I clean mine"  
...

The top of your RV needs to be cleaned periodically. A clean roof keeps
the sides of your RV cleaner and it allows inspection of caulk seams and
flashings. My RV has a ladder and is built so I can walk on it without
worry of damage.

A bucket and mop will suffice but I found the same product I use to
clean and wax the sides of my RV works as well on the top. Note, I have
a fiberglass roof. If you have a roof made out of a different material,
use a product appropriate for that purpose.

I use a waterless wash and wax system called, "Wash Wax All". It comes
from the Aerospace industry and I've used it now for a couple of years
on RV. It pretty much works as advertised. I suspect the other waterless
wash/wax systems from Meguiars, Chemical Guys, Mothers, etc. work just
as well.

The two-headed applicator is the key to going fast. Squirt the "Wet" side
with Wash Wax All, apply, flip to the "Dry" side and rub off. It goes quick
and the results are excellent. Another advantage is you don't need to
haul a bucket and hose up to the roof.

Below are a couple of videos of before and after.

title:  "Things I didn't understand about my coach"  
...

Being new the RV Class A thing and all, there were some rather embarrassing things I had to learn on our first trip out this Spring. 

![clipboard](http://i.imgur.com/dhAFau6.png)

- Water pressure requires a pump when not hooked to an external water source. I knew this. What I didn't know was that there was a switch **inside** to turn the water pump on. First few days I would head out to the water bay to switch on the pump and wondering why they don't have a switch on the inside. 

- One has to turn the inverter on to get 110 in the coach. 

- The steps would only retract when the coach was started. There's a switch to have them stay extended except when the motor is on. 

- The toilet works better when the water pump is on. 

- The steering wheel not only tilts but can be raised and lowered (with a good push). 

- The water pump only works if the coach power is turned on.

- Do not get your face too close to a storage bay door while slamming it shut. 

- Slide outs only work when the coach engine is not running. 

- The gas heater eats propane like crazy. 

- Windshield washers spray a lot of water into the lanes next to you. Surprisingly, some drivers recent getting a free car wash. 

- Air horns rock! 

Most of this pretty harmless although I did have a few uncomfortable minutes in the bathroom figuring out why the water pump would not turn on. 

Anyone else care to share?

title: Numbers Matter  
...

Many motorhome brochures contain a *specs* page. A table with numbers
and abbreviations can usually be found there. Here's an example:

![example table of specifications](http://i.imgur.com/q5GoBuk.png)

Many of these numbers are easily understood like height and width but
others are less obvious. GAWR, GVWR, GCWR, UVW, and NCCC may seem
obscure but in truth, they are some of the most important in determining
if the coach will have enough capacity to service your needs. These
numbers can also explain why one model costs more than another even
though they appear similar.

**GAWR**: Gross Axle Weight Rating is the maximum permissible weight for
the axle.

**GVWR**: Gross Vehicle Weight Rating is the maximum permissible weight
for a fully loaded motor coach.

**GCWR**: Gross Combination Weight Rating is the value specified by the
manufacturer of the vehicle as the maximum allowable loaded weight of
this motor coach and any towed trailer or towed vehicle.

**UVW**: Unloaded Vehicle Weight is the weight of this motor coach as
built at the factory with full fuel, engine oil and coolants. Does not
include cargo, fresh water, propane gas or dealer installed accessories.

**NCC**: Net Carrying Capacity is the maximum weight of all occupants
including the driver, personal belongings, food, fresh water, waste
water, propane gas, tools, tongue weight of towed vehicle,
dealer-installed accessories, etc., that can be carried by the motor
coach.

The table above is of particular interest because it was for a coach I
was considering buying. The numbers appear pretty good but the devil as
always is in the details.

First, these numbers apply to a coach with only the base options. Any
additional options will add weight and reduce payload.

Let's looks the first line of the second table (model 3412).

If we look at the **NCC** column we see we can put 5300 lbs of stuff in
our RV. That's a very good number. Many RV's have much lower NCC's (2000
lbs or less).

But remember that's for a base coach. I wanted additional features like
a larger refrigerator and bigger generator. That reduced the NCC to
about 4000 lbs. Seems like plenty but consider we have not loaded up our
RV yet. So let's run some numbers:

13 gallons of DEF fluid = 90 lbs  
Family of 4 = 600 lbs  
Propane = 32 lbs  
Food, dishes, chairs, books, junk, etc = 2,000 lbs

So our total is approximately 2,700 lbs

Recall the NCC for this model is about 4,000 lbs with options so we can
load her up and still have about 1,300 lbs to spare.

But I also want to tow a car to avoid having to move my Class A in and
out of camp to go sight seeing.

To tow a car I'll need:

Tow dolly = 500 lbs  
Car = 3,500 lbs  
Tongue weight: 100 lbs

or about 4100 lbs.

We add the 100 lbs of the tongue weight to the cargo load giving us a
total cargo load of $3,300 lbs. We're within the limits of this coach.

There's another number we need to worry about. It's **GCWR**. Recall
this is combined weight of the motor coach and towed vehicle.

So let's run the numbers.

UVW = 25,700 lbs  
Additional options = 1,300 lbs  
Cargo, people, etc = 2,700 lbs  
Tongue weight = 100 lbs Towed weight = 4,000 lbs

The total combined weight is 33,800 lbs.

The **GCWR** for this coach is 33,000 lbs.

Oops! We're too heavy. Now one could argue my numbers are too high for
cargo but I'm being conservative for my own peace of mind.

And keep in mind the numbers for this coach are much better than average
for the price point I'm thinking about. Considering how much money we
are spending, the cost of moving up outweighed the stress I was feeling
about weight limits.

In the end, I opted for the next level up. Same floor plan, same length
but with a larger tow capacity, **GCWR** and **GVWR**. Doing the math
saved me from a nasty surprise of overloading my motor coach and
possibly damaging it.

I know crunching the numbers isn't for everyone but considering the
amount of money involved it's worth the effort. If you are uncomfortable
doing this, ask your dealer to help you do these calculations. If the
dealer resists, maybe you should consider looking elsewhere.

The real cost differences of higher priced models aren't in the trim but
in bigger engines, beefier transmissions and more robust axles. Take the
time to understand the numbers and you will have fewer regrets later.

title: Acme Tow Dolly Delivery and Setup  
...

After much research and endless second guessing, I bought a tow dolly
from [Acme Tow Dolly](http://cartowdolly.com/). So far it's been a great
experience. In this post I'll talk about delivery and setup. Next time
I'll discuss actual use.

Acme only sells direct from the factory in North Carolina. If you're not
close by, they will ship it to you for $349. This includes delivery to
your residence with lift gate service.

The truck arrived as scheduled but I could see the lift gate was not
large enough for the crate. It took a little finagling to lower the
crate with the lift gate.

I don't know what it is about trucking companies but they often beat the
crap out of shipping containers. This was no exception. The crate was
busted up in places. However, the crate did it's job and protected the
dolly. Not a scratch.

So far, I'm very pleased with the tow dolly construction and setup.

The rest of this post contains several videos detailing delivery and
setup.

title: Scan Documents to PDF with Google Drive
---

Like many of you, I keep a manila file filled with receipts of service
done on my RV. However, I like to keep backups of these important
receipts. An easy way to do this is to take a picture of the receipt and
store it in a cloud service like Google Photos.

But I take lots of photos and photos require extra work to crop and tag.
I prefer to scan my receipts to PDF files. Why? Because I can keep
multi-page receipts in one file and they are easily be printed.

But wait you say, I don't have a scanner. Well if you have a smart phone
I've got good news, you have one.

You'll need an app called, [Google
Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/). Google Drive is free,
private online-storage for your documents and spreadsheets.

Once Google Drive is installed (many smart phone vendors preinstall it),
open the Google Drive app and press the large plus button icon in the
lower right corner. Google Drive will open the camera. Simply take a
picture of your receipt. Google Drive is smart enough to crop and
straighten the image. If you have multiple pages or receipts, press the
"plus" button again to add them.

Press, "Save" to finish. The Google Drive app converts the images to a
PDF document and uploads it to Google Drive. You're done.

title:  "Dogbone Hangers in Electrical Bay"  
...

The storage in my electrical bay is tight. Especially since I added a hardwired surge suppressor (Progressive Industries). The dog bones kind of get in the way when I just toss them in this bay. So I made some hangers to keep them handy and out of the way.

The shoulders of the cords are conical so they wedge into the holes. The gap for wire body to slide through is a friction fit. It takes about 1-2 LBS of force to pull them through. There's little danger of these cords bouncing out of the hangers.

Recently, we visited [Mammoth
Cave](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mammoth_Cave_National_Park) in
Kentucky, the longest cave system in the world. It's also a [World
Heritage site](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/World_Heritage_site) and a
[Bio
Reserve](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Man_and_the_Biosphere_Programme#/Biosphere_reserves).
It's a special place and well worth a visit.

Unusual for a National Park, [there is no entrance
fee](https://www.nps.gov/maca/planyourvisit/basicinfo.htm). This was
part of an agreement to when the government purchased the lands
encompassing the cave system. There are charges for the cave tours.

There are 17 different cave tours offered by the park service ranging
from easy to very difficult although even the easy ones require a fair
bit of walking. We did two of the tours; The *Historic Tour* and *Domes
and Dripstones*. These are perhaps the two most popular tours. Both are
tours last about 2 hours.

There are a number of ranger talks conducted throughout the day and
evenings. These talks are free and informative.

Mammoth Cave is mostly a dry cave. They are gray and dull, not colorful
like [Blanchard Caves](http://www.blanchardsprings.org/) or [Carlsbad
Caverns](https://www.nps.gov/cave/index.htm). However, there is some
wonderful history and artifacts as related by the park rangers. Some
really neat graffiti from the 1800's using candle stippling is shown
below. If you're a history nut like me, you'll find much to enjoy.

Outside of the caves, there's not much to do in the area. This can be a
plus or a minus depending on your point of view. As national parks go,
Mammoth Cave is not crowded. You can move around the park with relative
ease without feeling like the entire world is visiting the same spot at
the same time. The one BBQ restaurant we went to was downright awful
(The BBQ Pit) although two others in the area looked promising.

Camping is plentiful and relatively cheap compared to other National
Park areas we've visited. We stayed at [Singing Hills RV Park and
Campground](http://www.singinghillsrvpark.com/). It's quiet, family
friendly and inexpensive. We stayed 4 nights and with our Passport
America discount it was about $20 a night with full hookups (including
50 amp). The proprietor is friendly and has a nice welcome packet
including information about local medical facilities and emergency phone
numbers for fire and police. A nice touch.

Wifi was actually quite good as campgrounds go. I could stream YouTube
videos at low quality most times of the day including evenings. There is
also a propane refill service on site.

### Corvette Museum

![corvette](https://i.imgur.com/8MXravX.jpg)

About 25 miles south of Mammoth Cave is the city of Bowling Green and
home to the both the [National Corvette
Museum](https://www.corvettemuseum.org/) and the [Corvette
Factory](https://www.corvettemuseum.org/visit/plant-tours/). The factory
was closed at the time of this writing for upgrades and retooling.

Admission is around $10 per adult and worth it. The museum is first-rate with lots of interactive displays, movies and of course cars. You
might recall a few years ago the museum suffered a sinkhole
catastrophe. In a case of making lemonade from lemons, the museum
restored the collapsed section and [features it as an
exhibit](https://www.corvettemuseum.org/corvette-cave-in-exhibit-opens-on-two-year-anniversary-of-museum-sinkhole/).
There's a 50's themed restaurant that we walked through but didn't dine
at. The reviews suggest the food is good.

And of course, you can get your picture superimposed on a corvette like
my kids did above.

### Whiskey

Mammoth Cave is about 60 miles south of Lexington, smack-dab in the
middle of Bourbon country. Distilleries include the big boys like
[Maker's Mark](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maker%27s_Mark#distillery),
[Wild
Turkey](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wild_Turkey_(bourbon)#distillery)
and [Jim Beam](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jim_Beam) along with dozens
of boutique distillers (and breweries). You'll see signs for the
[Kentucky Bourbon
Trail](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kentucky_Bourbon_Trail), a collection
of 13 signature distilleries at the helm of Kentuckyâ€™s world-famous
Bourbon culture, to the 14 craft distilleries using innovative
approaches to reimagine a timeless tradition.

We only had time to visit one distillery, the [Corsair
Distillery](http://www.corsairdistillery.com/home) in Bowling Green. The
tour is $8 if you want to sample (highly recommend). They have unusual
offerings including whiskey infused with hops.

### Ice Cream

Bowling Green has a touristy dairy farm called Chaney's. The ice cream
is good but I would not go out of my way. Still, it's a pleasant
enough stop if you're nearby.

### Comments about clean RV

While in the campground, I kept getting questions about how I keep the
RV so clean and shiny. I do not regularly wash and wax the coach but I
do have a system to keep is clean and shiny requiring no water and
little time. I'll save that for a future article.

### GPS and route planning

All GPS's suck for RV travel, even the ones designed for RV travel. I
know, I've tried most of them. The gold standard (IMO) is Google Maps
and well, it sucks too. Mostly these apps suck because they try to
optimize the route too much. In RV, a 10-minute delay is no big deal and
I really don't want to leave my predetermined path. Why? Because my RV
is long and tall. I routinely plan routes to go around cities and of
course to avoid low clearance obstacles.

I've found the app on my phone does not allow the addition of
waypoints easily. And if you save a route to your phone it will only
remember beginning and endpoints and forget all the drag and reroute
actions I add.

The trick I found is set way-points in the desktop version that route
you as desired. Sending the route to your phone with way-points works
correctly and keeps you on the desired path.

### Wigwam Villages

Yep, near Cave City is one of the [famous Wigwam
Motels](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wigwam_Motel). There's a souvenir
shop inside if that's your thing.

If you're not familiar with [360 Siphon
Vents](http://www.lci1.com/360-siphon) you should be. They're an
inexpensive and easy way to reduce sewer odors in your RV. Don't take my
word for it. Checkout the RV Geeks video below.

The RV Geeks show you how to do an install by removing the old vent. The
360 Siphon Vents can also be retrofitted on an existing vent.

I found retrofitting to be easier, faster and require fewer tools than
the full-removal method.

If you have a vent that can be retrofitted, I recommend doing it that
way. If it doesn't work out, you can always do the full-removal method
afterwards.

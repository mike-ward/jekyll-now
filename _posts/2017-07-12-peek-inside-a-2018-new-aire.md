title:  "Peek Inside a 2018 New Aire"  
...

I was over at Midway RV the other day. The 2018 New Aire is a model that was not available last year. Good thing. I probably would have spent a lot more money. :smile:

Some quick observations:

- Under storage is amazing for a coach this size. They did something with the chassis rails to raise them out of the way in the basement.
- Three interior steps instead of two. Much nicer for my old man knees!
- Seamless tile floor due to the hydraulic slides. Nice!
- The exit door is something they should put on all models. Just makes so much sense.
- The interior finish is nice. Not too glitzy like you see in the luxury models.
- The cockpit is super cool!

My cell phone camera is not the best.

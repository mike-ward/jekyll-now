I suppose I should put something quick and witty about myself here but
then I’m neither so that’s not going to work. I enjoy writing software
and have always enjoyed fiddling with technology. I’ve been a pilot and
a sailor, a beer maker and a woodworker. There’s not much that doesn’t
interest me as along has it doesn’t involve religion or politics.

As you can see, the dolphin is far more photogenic than I am.

I'm no expert at RV's. In fact, I'm a newbie, fresh with enthusiasm and
short on knowledge. Follow me as I learn the ins and outs of RV-ing.
I'll share what I learn and hopefully we'll have fun on the way.

Welcome to our RV experiment. My wife Jean and I decided we needed to
move in a new direction so we have started RV'ing part-time with our
kids (Rachel and Peter). Buying a big motor home and committing to more
time away from our suburban lives is scary and challenging, but then
most things in life worth doing usually are.

I'm no expert at RV's. In fact, I'm a newbie, fresh with enthusiasm and
short on knowledge. Follow us as we learn the ins and outs of RV-ing.
We'll share what we learn and hopefully have fun on the way.
